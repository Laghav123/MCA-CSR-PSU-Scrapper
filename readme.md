This code scrapes data from the GOV website csr.gov.in
it scape the csr spend of all the PSU companies for last 5 financial year and saves it in csv format

you have to manually change the values in code for doing it for different year


- Install requirements.txt
- Download Chromedriver or other according to your OS compatibility and substitute its Path
- Read the comments throughout the code and disable the code you don't need 

the code can fail in various ways, believe me the problem is from website side bcoz of slow server
  the same code will work if you try again

Later I will try to make an input system to run the app, so that you don't need to change the looping values manually in the code
